## 🔬 Analytical Projects

The repository is organized by Jupyter Notebooks, each representing a complete analytical study:

### 1. Analyzing Performance Trends in Wimbledon 2023

* **Sport:** Tennis (Wimbledon Grand Slam)
* **Goal:** Conduct an in-depth analysis of player performance during the 2023 Wimbledon tournament.
* **Key Focus Areas (Inferred):** Analyzing serve statistics (aces, double faults), win/loss records, match duration, tie-breaker performance, and identifying key statistical differences between winners and losers.

### 2. ISL Prediction (Indian Super League)

* **Sport:** Football/Soccer (Indian Super League)
* **Goal:** Build a predictive model to forecast match outcomes (win, loss, or draw) or team performance in the Indian Super League (ISL).
* **Key Focus Areas (Inferred):** Feature engineering from historical match data, player statistics, team form, and applying machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries

The core of these projects relies on the Python data science stack:

* **Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Machine Learning (Inferred):** `scikit-learn` (used for the prediction task)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
